            <h2>5.6. Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Nothing in this Agreement affects the contractual liberty of both parties. Nothing in these Terms of Service
                positions the Service as a Party in a mutually-accepted agreement between a specific Buyer and User Listing.
                The Service disclaims all liability from actions caused by any Buyer or User Listing on the Service. If,
                by court order, operation or interpretation of law, the Service has been deemed as liable for any costs or
                damages by actions of any Users and/or Visitors of the Service, DollarTube reserves full regress claims toward
                any User. DollarTube’s Website, content and services are all provided on an “as is” and “as offered” basis.
                DollarTube does not unilaterally provide any express or implied terms, representations, warranties or conditions.
                DollarTube, its employees, offices, agents or other representatives are further not liable, to the maximum
                extent permitted by law for any: direct, indirect, special or consequential loss; business or private losses,
                including: income, savings, or profit loss, loss of contract, loss of goodwill or representations loss, warranty
                loss, data corruption, personal loss. The aforementioned limitations are voided in the exclusive case that
                DollarTube has willingly voided its limitation of liability in a specific Set of Terms and/or Contract. Limitations
                apply in the case that DollarTube had been advised of the potential loss. DollarTube does not take any responsibility
                for the unreasonable behavior of visitors and/or third parties. Furthermore, DollarTube does not take any
                responsibility for publishing any content, which is not in any way meant to constitute and/or provide any
                type of professional advice. DollarTube is further not responsible in any way, to no extent in the unlikely
                case of severe host and/or server failure or breach, or any other Vis major, which is not in scope of DollarTube’s
                ability to control. This disclaimer cannot and will not exclude any warranty or liability implied by U.S.
                Governing law, will not exclude and/or limit any warranty or liability which is illegal or unlawful to limit
                or exclude in compliance with U.S. Governing law. You hereby understand this liability limitation statement,
                and are fully compliant with it in its entirety. DollarTube’s failure to act in a particular circumstance
                does not waive the ability to act in respect to the specific circumstance or circumstances similar to it.
                If any provision of these Terms is rendered invalid by statutory provisions, interpretation of law or its
                application, rendered unenforceable, it shall not affect the remainder of these terms. The remaining terms
                shall stay in full force and effect. Section headings are made for convenience. They do not have to correspond
                with the content of the appropriate section and do not have any legal effect. In the event that DollarTube
                goes through a business transition (merger, acquisition, sale of assets etc.), your personal information
                and content uploaded by you will likely be among the assets transferred accordingly to the title of transfer
                under which the information and content are being owned or used by the Service. You will be notified via
                email of any such change of ownership of your personal information.</p>
